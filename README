v 0.1

Takes options of topOffset to help align properly
and structure to allow the user to indicate their own 
string of HTML for the structure. To do this, one needs
to indicate a container with the class of "tooltipContent"
for the title to be written correctly.

Usage - 
create a href link with a class of "easyTooltip" and give it a title with the
information you want in the tooltip.
Then put in your document.ready:

$easy_tooltip(".easyTooltip", {
	topOffset: [an integer value],
	structure: [an HTML string for layout]
});

All options are optional. Tee-hee.
